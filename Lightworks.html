				<p>As someone who is very passionate about music, I've always constantly paid attention to its rhythm,
					meaning, and feeling. Iâ€™m someone who likes to captivate all those feelings into a visual work that
					Iâ€™m proud of. This work that I created was in my Art 74 class in Fall 2019. The song I did for this
					project is by J Dilla, who was a record producer and rapper in the hip-hop scene of Detroit,
					Michigan. </p>
				<p>I've grown to like his music within the past few years because his music wasnâ€™t popular in the 2000s.
					What I found interesting about this sample he used, is the song called "Lightworks", which also
					complies with the spiritual belief that an individual is a "Lightworker", meaning a special person
					with almost psychic ability to sense what other people are thinking, feeling, or need in order to
					heal.
				</p>
				<p>My concept behind this video is basically the evolution of how video FX has drastically changed from
					manually making overlays to futuristically digitally adding overlays using software programs.
					Conceptually, the girl in the video basically sees what the future has in store for society like, as
					televisions are created, computer editing programs are created, as well as the makeup/beauty
					revolution. The constant destruction of social media often leads us into the depths of our own
					darkness, and you feel stuck to where you feel panicky, without your devices and/or feel the need to
					assimilate with new devices and what society expects. Without knowing, J Dilla also added in an
					ad-lib from the same artist he used the Lightworks sample that said, "Bendix The Tomorrow People",
					which actually is from a commercial promoting a company that made aircraft and automobile fuel
					control systems, radios, televisions and computers from 1924 to 1983.</p>
