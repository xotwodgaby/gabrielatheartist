				<p>This photo was taken while being in the conference room of The Mercury News in Downtown San Jose. I
					captured this very moment as the sky was in a haze due to the 2018 California wildfires that were
					occurring, which happened to be the deadliest and most destructive wildfires in history. I loved the
					aesthetic of this photo and I decided to take a quick snapshot before my mom and I left the
					building. As it did look beautiful on camera, with the natural glow of the sun beaming through the
					hazy clouds, it still was quite concerning. In that moment, I realized reality itself. The photo
					came out so crisp on my phone that I couldnâ€™t believe that I was living in that moment. My mind
					could not help lingering about the aesthetic of the raw image as it made me feel nostalgic of the
					memories I shared with my mom while exploring San Jose together. The Mercury News had just moved to
					the building I took this photo in before being on Ridder Park Drive since 1967.
				</p>
				<p>I was very proud of my mother, as she had her little beginnings in Ridder Park. That was her first
					job, at 18 years young, and she started with a little job near the mailing room. Now, she is the executive assistant to
					the big bosses. Although she loved the new building and the new sights she was able to look upon,
					she couldnâ€™t help but always reminisce about the memories she shared at Ridder Park with past
					coworkers.
				</p>
				<p>The amount of love I have for this woman is like no other. As I was staring across the buildings and
					towards the streets of the place I call home, I was reminded of the obstacles my mother faced and
					the hard work she put in to be in the place where she is now, and to put me into my dream school.
