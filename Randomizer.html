				<p>If you‚Äôve ever seen the movie Devil‚Äôs Advocate (1997) that most notably stars Keanu Reeves and Al
					Pacino, you must be familiar with the meaning behind it. Devil‚Äôs Advocate explores how ambition and
					the pursuit of power can be one's undoing. Temptation is one hell of a feeling, especially as it can
					often mislead us into doing things that cannot be explained. Evil is not an outside force but rather
					it reigns inside us. Satan doesn't tempt us to sin, we're already tempted, especially after I‚Äôve
					revisited The Book of Genesis in a class that I have taken at San Jose State University, called
					Death, Dying, and Religion. After that class, I have come to the realization that the devil urges us
					to yield to our temptations instead of manipulating us to commit sin.</p>
				<p>I‚Äôve demonstrated this in my photo,for my photography course at SJSU, as I was subsequently watching the movie on the laptop screen
					behind my hand. The quote reads, ‚ÄúNever loses, like you. Ha! Ha! Ha!‚Äù from Al Pacino‚Äôs character
					playing Satan. The scene in that movie refers to Al Pacino‚Äôs and Keanu Reeves‚Äô characters visiting a
					market in which Pacino asks a vendor for a chicken that characteristically plays tic-tac-toe. Reeves
					looks dazed in confusion as Pacino indicates that the Chicken never loses, like him. It‚Äôs then
					translated to Pacino figuratively calling Keanu a chicken, since he does not take risks, but does
					what is right. This shows that Satan plays games with individuals to yield temptations that will
					make us appear cold and ambitious.
				</p>
				<p>Internet society has become quite ugly these past few years as I have the urgence to quit social
					media sometimes due to witnessing body shaming to misogynistic and homophobic remarks, etc.
					Sometimes people often get too caught up in these topics that they often potentially hurt themselves
					or hurt others. When is the right time to step away from doing what is right, or rather when is it
					okay to put our foot down and stand up for ourselves, even if it might ruin our reputation?
