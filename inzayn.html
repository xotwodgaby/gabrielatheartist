					INZAYN is a conceptual piece that I made as a submission for a merchandise piece for my favorite
					artist, Zayn Malik. In the watermark, it states @merchforzayn which was an account dedicated to the
					work that my friend and I planned on showcasing to his team. During this time, on Twitter, I once
					went by the name “ZAYNGONADA”, which was an alias in tribute to zayn and my obsession with
					mangonadas, a mango speciality known in Latin American countries. I posted my art on this account
					from 2014-2018, and during this period, I was able to get noticed by Zayn multiple times. I knew his
					team through a mutual friend who had access to a lot of information from his team, at the time. I
					submitted this piece for a t-shirt idea in hopes of obtaining a chance to work and collaborate with
					Zayn. This was the moment I realized that with my artistic abilities, I would be able to collaborate
					with celebrities in order to create merchandise pieces that are meaningful to both fans and the
					musician themselves. I know it’s often a hassle for musicians who don’t have the artistic abilities
					to create drawings or mockups to convey their vision within merchandise pieces or album cover works.
					Being able to get the chance to work with musicians would be a dream, and hopefully in the future I
					will find myself getting to change it into a reality.

				</p>
				<p>In this piece, I portray Zayn Malik’s face spliced with both a skeleton and flesh side profile. Also
					what is seen is his brain getting abducted by an alien spaceship that is hovering over his head. I
					played on the words “insane” to “inzayn” to show that he is losing his mind due to the aliens
					capturing his sanity. I went with the ideas of aliens due to his debut album discussing his love for
					aliens and the concept of going into a different reality.
