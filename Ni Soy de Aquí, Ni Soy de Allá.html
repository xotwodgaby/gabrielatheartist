				<p>
					Growing up, I was always told to be proud of where I came from, where my blood came from, and what
					my ancestors did to sacrifice for our family to survive. In this painting, I portray myself in the
					middle and two sides of my ancestry, one being an Aztec and the other side a Lipan Apache warrior. I
					decided to put them two in their natural environments, one being in the Tenochtitlan and the other
					in the Southern Texas plains.
				</p>
				<p>On my father’s side, my family came from the Guamares and the Aztecs. As for my mother’s side, came
					the Coahuiltecans and Lipan Apaches. I’ve always had them in my mind whenever I try to achieve
					something and I always thank them in gratitude and honor them. The reason behind the title “Ni Soy
					de Aquí, Ni Soy de Allá”, translates to “I’m not from here, nor am I from there”, which correlates
					to my own identification of being a Mexican-American in this day and age.Where I am too American for
					Mexico, but too Mexican for the United States. My family has it’s ties from the colonization of
					converting to Catholicism which was enforced by missionaries and the Spanish Inquisition.
				</p>
				<p>Overtime, I’ve realized how much my family has colonized themselves from our own spiritual beliefs
					that we once had before having to convert. My grandmother, who is of Apache and Coahuiltecan
					descent, has the knowledge of spirituality which has inspired me to decolonize myself from these
					generational curses of following the Catholic religion.In my life, I have had a connection with many
					types of insects and animals that include: Butterflies, Dragonflies, and Hummingbirds. The Dragonfly
					and the Hummingbird that I showcased in this painting signify my spirtual beliefs in reincarnation.
					These forms of life have followed me and reminded me of peace and tranquility which has taught me to
					live for the future. These animals have watched over me, and within my beliefs, I believe for them
					to be blessings of life.
					To say that I am not in favor of Catholicism is not true, since I base a lot of my work from
					Catholic-art forms like Roman Catholic iconography, but rather I am decolonizing from the roots it
					stems from such as: rape of indigenous women, destruction of idols, temples, the kidnapping of the
					Aztec children, spread of diseases, the killings of the noblity, etc.
