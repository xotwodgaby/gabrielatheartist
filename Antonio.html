					<br> <b> Acrylic Paint on Canvas </b> </br>
					<b> 12 x 12 in </b> </br> </p>
				<p>Antonio is a portrait I painted of my grandfather when he was little. This piece is very important to
					me, especially since I wanted to captivate the perspective of innocence and curiosity. I painted
					this piece on a small canvas, and the reason I did that is because compared to a huge canvas,
					personally it would not portray the perception I wanted to convey. I correlate huge canvases to
					people who are of age, whereas small canvases can often portray the smallness of the person or
					object. .</p>
				<p>My grandfather is one of the primary reasons as to why I continue doing what I do, since I feel like
					a part of my purpose is to fulfill the dream that he once wanted. His innocence was stolen at a
					young age with the obstacles he had to face without having a father figure in his life. The abuse
					that his mother faced was something that could not be apprehended by a child his age, and let alone
					should not be something he had to think about. The curiosity of his consciousness made him wonder
					about the whereabouts of his father as he was often away and his promises were always forever
					broken.
