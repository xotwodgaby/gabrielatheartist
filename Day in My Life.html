				<p style="text-align:center;"> <b>ðŸ“Œ Day in My Life ðŸ“Œ </b>
					<br> <b> Adobe Premiere Pro / Personal Footage </b> </br>
					<b> 1280 x 720 </b> </br>
					<b> Duration: 01:23 | single-screen MP4-video | year: 2021 </b></p>
				<p>In this video, I wanted to showcase what it is like to live a day in my life. While growing up, I
					always woke up to the sounds of music in the air and the smell of chorizo and the cleaning supply,
					Fabuloso. As I started my day, it is always helping my mom with breakfast or my grandparents,
					depending on wherever I am at, and then straight to cleaning. I included clips of things that I
					remember when thinking about the sounds that are familiar in my home.
					I included clips that correlate to these sounds, such as the dancing to the music being played from
					our speakers to the Doveâ€™s coos from outside.
				</p>
				<p>After cleaning, the video pans out to leading the camera into my room, where my streaming happens. I
					demonstrate what I do to set up my stream, and I try to do this without using my voice, as I wanted
					to captivate the noises that surround me since I feel like as a streamer, we often talk a lot and
					there isnâ€™t enough attention to the sounds that are surrounding the environment we are in.

				</p>
				<p>As a streamer, I found it hard to live in a Mexican-household, especially while having a bunch of
					responsibilities already planned out for you because of generational expectations. The daughter in
					the household, especially the oldest, often do the cooking and the cleaning after everyone, and the
					sons often get to do whatever they want to do. I am often given my priorities rather than for me to
					choose my own. I wanted to pursue and establish a following while streaming, only for it to be kind
					of pushed to the side due to lack of understanding from one of my family members. In correlation to
					this, in the video, I placed snippets of what I listen to, which is The Weeknd and his song
					in particular, "Trust Issues". This song in particular is also kind of sad, but very representative
					of a cultural change in the house as I listen to both English and Spanish language songs. Also, the
					song portrays a depressive state in which I constantly feel uncomfortable having fun and enjoying my
					life after doing chores or following through with responsiblities. The game Fortnite is also being
					played with the small indications of the keyboard tapping and the gameplay noises. Fornite was one
					of those games to me, that I used not only to have fun with,but
					was used as a method to escape while I was going through a difficult time.
