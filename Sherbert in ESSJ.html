				<p>The photo in this picture was taken with an iPhone 7 camera in front of my grandparentsâ€™ home in
					Eastside San Jose. I thought the orangey-pink clouds looked gorgeous against the blue sky. For some
					reason, it reminded me of the times I spent there as a child, waiting for my mom to pick me up from
					work. One particular memory I reflected upon was when I would eat Push-pop Sherbet Ice-creams during
					the summer, cooling down from the heat. The colors of the sherbert were the same colors as the sky
					was on that day. I remembered the Paletera (Ice Cream Woman) who came in my neighborhood with her
					jingle, where she sold cotton candy, chicharrones, elote, fruit and ice cream. That jingle no longer
					sounded through the cul de sac and the streets of the neighborhood. The realization that I was
					getting older dawned upon me. </p>
				<p>It was almost like a movie, I felt the world caving in as I recalled the many kids running around the
					streets and making a whole lot of noise. Now itâ€™s a ghost town, silent as ever. The kids disappeared
					and now live in other cities, or on their own now as we were all around the same age. In the photo,
					there is a visible house underneath the palm trees. This house was once home to my first friends in
					my life. Even though they were 4,3 and 1 year older than me, they still made me feel like I
					belonged. They moved away suddenly without telling me, and my memory of our last time altogether
					faded. I sometimes wish I couldâ€™ve cherished those times with the neighborhood children more, as I
					never realized how much I took them for granted.
