				<p>With hard work comes great consequences. This video describes the struggles of modern-day
					father-daughter relationships, specifically due to lack of communication and emotional support from
					immigrant fathers who spend most of their lives working and not being able to spend time with their
					children.</p>
				<p>There was a lot to uncover when creating this project. I remember clearly having a first-time
					discussion with someone about my relationship with my father, who did not know who he was. Little
					did I know this person had a father similar to mine. We shared stories about our fatherâ€™s and I was
					able to uncover some realizations that this person brought upon me about my father that I never
					thought about. It made me feel bitter about the way I felt about my dad and made me feel yet sad
					because I knew I would not have the same father as I did many years ago, who I truly miss. With
					this, I was able to create a more in-depth expression within my project the following day when I
					began to work on it. I decided that instead of showcasing a video full of random strangersâ€™ home
					videos, I used my own photographic footage to depict the once cheerful stories I would tell about my
					father and I when I was young.
				</p>
				<p>This video not only allowed me to configure certain emotions about someone but also allowed me to
					explore many parallel techniques, such as taking one photo and morphing it into a photo similar to
					it. I realized how important it was for me to reflect on this story and become stronger when
					speaking about it to others, especially to a class of 22 students and 1 professor who know
					absolutely nothing about you. I plan on writing more about my father and Iâ€™s story because I feel
					like itâ€™s very relatable and something that needs to be heard for people like me. This leads me to
					my next project of wanting to write a memoir about my life. </p>
