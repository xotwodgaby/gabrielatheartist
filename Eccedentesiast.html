					<br> <b> Acrylic Paint, Glitter, and Bristol Paper </b> </br>
					<b> 14x17 in </b> </br> </p>
				<p>In this piece, I created a painting with elements of both 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional aspects. In
					our everyday lives, others can 3-dimensionally witness when someone is not feeling the best, and
					sometimes others cannot. What nobody else can see is the 2-dimensional battle within ourselves and
					reality. This piece morally means a lot to me and conveys a deeper meaning and story especially even
					after this piece was made. This piece remains close to my heart than any other painting I‚Äôve made,
					not only because it was made at the hardest time of my life thus far (and hopefully never again),
					but because of the personalization and the trial and errors I‚Äôve made to convey true emotion and
					feel for audiences.

				</p>
				<p>In August 2019, something terribly unexpected happened that caused me to rethink everything in my
					life. I was in a whirlwind of emotions; anger, sadness, anxiousness, fear and so much more. ‚ÄúAfter
					Every Storm, There‚Äôs Sunshine‚Äù is a reminder to myself that not everything bad lasts forever. This
					is shown as the figure (being me) stepping out of a dark storm and into the light as a golden
					butterfly leads her into this delightful garden with beautiful flowers and music. Music being one of
					the truest things that stuck with me the whole time I was going through this troublesome time. This
					painting was made on Bristol paper with Acrylic paint. I used different shades of glitter such as
					silver and gold to emphasize the thunder and lightning in the dark background of the figure and as
					well as gold for the butterfly that is flying ahead of the figure. If you look closely, there is a
					shiny gloss used on top of the eyes, I used a varnish gloss to give the appearance of the eyes that
					they are crying. The 3D aspect of this painting is shown in the grass as I layered pieces of bristol
					paper together to create dimension and movement in the painting.

				</p>
				<p>The person that caused me this pain asked me the next day (when my painting was done) why I was
					crying. I had nothing really to say to that, just silence. No matter how much emotion I could show
					to this person, they would rather choose ignorance over caring for their own daughter‚Äôs feelings.
					Being able to walk away from the situation was not easy, but to rather heal my wounds and head to
					the light where the grass is greener, is where I found that I belonged. Check on your friends,
					family, and even those who appear strangers to you. Someone could truly be doing the worst without
					even showing it, as I did.
