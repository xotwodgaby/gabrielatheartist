					<b>2000â€ŠÃ—â€Š1270</b> </br> </p>
				<p>During this glitch experimentation, I practiced on something I knew familiarly. I chose a photo of
					Zayn Malik since he is someone that I could place in anything conceptual, especially since I found
					him very interesting. I chose a photo that was taken on the red carpet for the Grammys. When I was
					listening to the Audacity file, It was very static-y almost like small little screams here and
					there, not scary ones but similar to the sound I once heard when I went to see him in concert with
					the other 4 group members. Going to a One Direction concert was quite the experience, especially
					when you would leave the venue with blared-out ears from the constant screams that my ears took in.
				</p>
				<p> When I was moving and deleting some of the code around, a section of exposure was revealed. I
					immediately thought about flash photography that is familiarized with red-carpet events. When
					watching the red carpets live on tv, the flash photography often strobes against the individual, and
					therefore this reminded me of that, especially when the individual moves from their spot. I also
					wanted to discuss the distinctiveness in which we idolize these individuals, although they are just
					like you and me. What also made me realize is that some of us can recognize these individuals just
					by their face, hair, stature, or clothes really is mesmerizing because of our interest in media and
					culture.
